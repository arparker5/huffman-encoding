# Huffman-encoding
The program encodes input string with the Huffman method and output the binary code of string.

Program code is [here](https://github.com/AlexNickrodef/huffman-encoding/blob/master/huffman/huffman.cpp).

In the future, I will describe here the principle of the method and describe its positive and negative sides.

*Thanks for help H.S!*
